Linux is a distributed OS based on Unix. This means that with linux installed multiple people can parallely access the system and work on it.

Your typical system looks like this:

Let us focus on layer 4. The **shell** is a program that takes some input from the keyboard and gives it to the OS to perform. In linux we have programs like bash or zsh that acts as the shell. In this layer we also have another program called the **terminal emulator**. This is a program that lets you interact with the shell.

In most servers we use the shell/terminal to do stuff because a lot of the system resources are consumed by the UI.
